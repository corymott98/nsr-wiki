## Definition

The **North Star Race Clean®** system is a system to document, prevent, and penalize poor driving standards in online simulated racing leagues. **Race Clean®** works in conjunction with the North Star Licenses to prioritize clean, incident free racing. **Race Clean®** uses “RC Points” as the main form of documentation to track incidents occurring on the race track during the course of a race and the season.

## RC Points

1. RC Points are assessed in various situations to penalize and document poor driving standards during the course of a race. RC Points will be assessed against specific member licenses. **RC Points will accumulate a running total** and carry from event to event. North Star Staff and Series Directors reserve the right to assess RC Points at their discretion based on the table below:

|                 Action                 |     Penalty      |
| :------------------------------------: | :--------------: |
|       Self Spin Causing Caution        |    1 RC Point    |
|        Member Generated Protest        | 1 \- 2 RC Points |
|       Causing Caution (2+ Cars)        |   2 RC Points    |
| Egregious  **OR** Intentional incident |  2-3 RC Points   |

2. Completing a clean race - **0 RC Points assessed to a member** - will result in subtracting **one (-1) RC point** from the running total. 
3. Members will be penalized when the running total of RC Points reaches specified amounts:

| RC Points |            Member Penalty            |
| :-------: | :----------------------------------: |
|     6     |          Loss of Qualifying          |
|     8     | License Demotion & 1 Race Suspension |

4. Drivers who serve a suspension will see the RC Point running total return to **4 RC Points**.
