This page outlines how **teams** function within North Star Racing, including eligibility, registration rules, roster limits, and team points calculations.

## Overview

The **Team System** is designed to promote collaboration, long-term competition, and season-wide strategy among drivers. Teams compete alongside individual drivers, with a dedicated **team prize pool** awarded at the end of the season.

> **Important:**  
> The Team System applies **only to the Cup Series**.  
> The Truck Series does **not** use teams or team points.

## Team Size Requirements

Each team must adhere to the following roster limits:

- **Minimum drivers:** 2  
- **Maximum drivers:** 4  

Teams that fall below the minimum driver requirement may be subject to removal from team standings.

- The Team Owner is responsible for:
  - Registering the team
  - Managing the team roster
  - Paying the team entry fee

### Entry Fee
- **Team Entry Fee:** **$15 per team**
- The entry fee:
  - Applies **only to Cup Series teams**

## Team Points System

Team standings are calculated using **season-long performance**, not race-by-race averages.

### Points Calculation Rules
- Team points are calculated using:
  - The **top 2 drivers** from each team
  - Based on **full-season points standings**
- Drivers are ranked internally within their team
- Only the **two highest-scoring drivers** contribute to team totals

### Key Notes
- Additional drivers (3rd or 4th) do **not** contribute points unless they finish inside the top two on their team
- Driver changes during the season may impact team eligibility and standings
