## Welcome to North Star Racing

Established in **2022** as the Sunday Night Showdown, **North Star Racing** has strived to create an authentic racing experience for all competitors on the **iRacing Simulation** platform. To achieve the goals of **maximizing competition**, while maintaining **affordability** for competitors, North Star Racing has established the **Rules & Regulations** document. This document **contains rules, regulations, and procedures** used for governing league members and league-sanctioned championships.

**Clean, hard, side-by-side racing** by all competitors of varying skill levels in an **authentic stock-car racing environment** remains the sole focus of **North Star Racing** heading into the 2026 season. 

The **North Star Rules & Regulations** documentation is designed to promote **realistic competition** while factoring the simulation aspect of the software. Where necessary, the rules and regulations outlined may not mirror reality due to limitations of the simulation software, fiscal limitations, or time restraints. The rules and regulations are crafted with the goal of keeping **North Star Racing** relevant in the **iRacing Simulation** league space, while protecting the participants.

As part of **North Star's** commitment to maintaining a proper balance in competition, it may be necessary from time to time for North Star Staff to make or recommend rule changes or adjustments. To maintain fairness and uphold the integrity of **North Star Racing**, North Star Staff reserves the right to penalize competitors and community members within the bounds of the **Rules & Regulations** documentation.

**North Star Racing** expects that **competitors and racing teams should largely police themselves**. When North Star Staff issue a penalty, it is to prevent major impacts or implications on the league’s integrity as a whole. 

The latest version of the **Rules & Regulations** documentation is a culmination of **4+ years of experience, learning, and knowledge**. Research has been completed diving into different sanctioning bodies, iRacing leagues/communities, and the iRacing Sporting Code to assemble the most comprehensive set of rules, regulations, and procedures for the 2026 competition year. **We advise competitors, team owners, and community members to study and familiarize yourself with the new Rules & Regulations document to understand where North Star Racing stands competitively for the 2026 season.**

We wish you a successful and competitive year of racing here at North Star Racing.
